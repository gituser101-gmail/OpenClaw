summary: "Lease-backed Gateway RPC contract for idempotent external subagent spawning"
title: "Lease-backed session spawning"
read_when:
  - You are building an external orchestrator that starts OpenClaw subagents
  - You need the exact allow-lease, metadata, replay, and recovery contract
  - You are integrating sessions_spawn with sessions_list, sessions_status, or sessions_history
---

External orchestrators can use the Agentic OS runtime contract to bind one
`sessions_spawn` request to one short-lived Gateway allow lease. The Gateway
persists the lease reservation before calling the real child-session runner,
then projects the accepted child identity through the session read methods.

Discover the methods with `tools.catalog`. They appear in `runtimeMethods` and
use the parameter names shown below.

## Authorization

Every connected client needs a stable authenticated identity. OpenClaw scopes
lease and spawn replay identities to that principal.

| Method                         | Required scope   |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| `subagents.allowLease.acquire` | `operator.admin` |
| `subagents.allowLease.status`  | `operator.read`  |
| `subagents.allowLease.release` | `operator.write` |
| `sessions_spawn`               | `operator.write` |
| `sessions_list`                | `operator.read`  |
| `sessions_status`              | `operator.read`  |
| `sessions_history`             | `operator.read`  |

For internal agent callers, `requester_agent_id` must match the authenticated
requester. A lease also binds `run_id`, `phase`, `transition_id`, `agent_id`,
and `client_lease_id`; `sessions_spawn` fails closed if any owner field differs.
External clients do not invent the requester id, and the Gateway does not trust
a caller-selected `requester_agent_id` as authority. Call `tools.catalog`
without `agentId`; the response is scoped to the configured default agent and
includes that resolved `agentId`. Use that exact value as
`requester_agent_id` when acquiring the lease.

## Workflow

1. Acquire an allow lease.
2. Call `sessions_spawn` once with the returned `gateway_lease_id` and exact v1
   metadata.
3. Persist the returned `session_key` and `runId`.
4. Read the accepted identity through `sessions_list`, `sessions_status`, and
   `sessions_history`.
5. Release the lease with a separate release idempotency key when cleanup is
   needed. A successfully spawned lease is already consumed.

## Acquire a lease

Call `subagents.allowLease.acquire` with:

```json
{
  "client_lease_id": "lease-01",
  "idempotency_key": "acquire-01",
  "run_id": "run-01",
  "phase": "B",
  "transition_id": "transition-01",
  "agent_id": "ai-engineer",
  "requester_agent_id": "main",
  "ttl_ms": 60000
}
```

All identity fields are required non-empty strings. `ttl_ms` is a positive
integer with a maximum of 86,400,000 milliseconds (24 hours). Identity strings
are trimmed before validation and before the Gateway builds the canonical
metadata and replay fingerprints; surrounding whitespace is never part of the
authorized agent identity.

The response includes `status`, `gateway_lease_id`, `external_id`, `lease`, and
`metadata`. Nonterminal lease statuses are `active` and `reserved`. `reserved`
means the durable spawn reservation exists while launch or replay is pending.
Terminal states are `consumed` and `released`. `metadata` has this envelope:

```json
{
  "metadata_contract_version": "v1",
  "normalized": {},
  "raw_json": "{}"
}
```

`normalized` contains the validated request identity. `raw_json` is its
deterministic canonical JSON projection.

Repeating the same acquisition idempotency key and exact fields returns the
same lease. Reusing either `idempotency_key` or `client_lease_id` with
conflicting fields is rejected.

## Spawn the child session

Call `sessions_spawn` with the acquired lease:

```json
{
  "task": "Run the bounded implementation phase",
  "taskName": "implementation",
  "runtime": "subagent",
  "mode": "run",
  "cleanup": "keep",
  "context": "isolated",
  "lightContext": false,
  "agentId": "ai-engineer",
  "client_request_id": "spawn-01",
  "idempotency_key": "spawn-idem-01",
  "gateway_lease_id": "gateway-lease:...",
  "metadata": {
    "run_id": "run-01",
    "transition_id": "transition-01",
    "client_request_id": "spawn-01",
    "idempotency_key": "spawn-idem-01",
    "phase": "B",
    "agent_id": "ai-engineer",
    "task_digest": "aa64985582ec710ff6cb61511413a970359aae3d4bba8c69b038f6456420d9c1"
  }
}
```

`metadata` must contain exactly the seven fields shown. `task_digest` is the
lowercase hexadecimal SHA-256 digest of the UTF-8 bytes of the normalized
launch task after the Gateway trims surrounding whitespace. For the example
above, the launched task is `Run the bounded implementation phase`, so
`task_digest` is
`aa64985582ec710ff6cb61511413a970359aae3d4bba8c69b038f6456420d9c1`.

Supported launch values are:

- `runtime`: `subagent`
- `mode`: `run` when supplied
- `cleanup`: `delete` or `keep`
- `context`: `isolated` or `fork`
- `lightContext`: boolean

`taskName`, `cleanup`, `context`, and `lightContext` are optional. When present,
`taskName` must be a string; it is trimmed and validated before it becomes part
of the replay identity. `agentId` defaults to `metadata.agent_id` and must equal
it when supplied. The Gateway validates and canonicalizes `agentId`,
`metadata.agent_id`, and lease `agent_id` with the same agent-id boundary used
by the child-session runner before authorization, replay digesting, reservation,
and response projection. Malformed strings such as provider error text are
rejected instead of being sanitized into agent ids.

An accepted response has `status: "accepted"` and includes the canonical
`session_key`, `childSessionKey`, `runId`, `gateway_lease_id`, request
identities, `metadata`, and a nested `session` projection. Exact retries return
the same accepted projection without launching another child. Conflicting
reuse of `idempotency_key` or `client_request_id` is rejected. The child
runner must return the exact session key and run ID reserved by the Gateway;
missing or divergent identities are treated as an operational contract
failure and are never published as accepted. Because the runner already crossed
its acceptance boundary, the one-shot lease becomes consumed/indeterminate and
cannot be reused to launch another child.

## Read session state

- `sessions_list` takes no parameters and returns only sessions owned by the
  authenticated principal.
- `sessions_status` takes `{ "session_key": "..." }`. Its `runtime_session`
  uses `runtime_status: "running"` while active, `"unavailable"` when no run
  state is known, or a canonical terminal reason: `completed`,
  `hard_timeout`, `timed_out`, `cancelled`, `aborted`, `blocked`, `abandoned`,
  or `failed`.
- `sessions_history` takes `{ "sessionKey": "...", "limit": 50,
"includeTools": false }`. `limit` must be a positive integer no greater than
  1000 and values above 1000 are rejected before transcript delegation.
  `includeTools` defaults to false so tool and tool-result messages are omitted.

The status and history methods verify the stored contract projection and then
read the canonical OpenClaw session. They do not expose raw provider failure
text through the runtime projection.

## Release, replay, and recovery

Release takes the lease owner fields plus `gateway_lease_id` and a distinct
`release_idempotency_key`:

```json
{
  "client_lease_id": "lease-01",
  "release_idempotency_key": "release-01",
  "run_id": "run-01",
  "phase": "B",
  "transition_id": "transition-01",
  "agent_id": "ai-engineer",
  "requester_agent_id": "main",
  "gateway_lease_id": "gateway-lease:..."
}
```

An exact release retry returns the same `status: "released"` response.

The Gateway persists acquisition, reservation, accepted-session, and release
replay state in its canonical SQLite state database:

- persisted lease, release, and spawn replay fingerprints are bounded
  cryptographic digests in `sha256:<64 lowercase hex>` form. The spawn replay
  digest is SHA-256 over the stable canonical spawn identity, which includes
  the normalized launch task for conflict detection, but the raw task text is
  not persisted in fingerprint fields;
- lease and release replay identities are retained for five minutes after
  becoming terminal;
- accepted session projections are retained for 24 hours and remain retained
  while their child run is active;
- a lease is rechecked for expiry immediately before its spawn reservation is
  persisted;
- an in-process concurrent exact spawn waits for the first result, while a
  conflicting spawn fails closed;
- before launch, the Gateway durably reserves a child session key and run ID;
- after restart, an orphaned reservation is promoted into the normal 24-hour
  session replay index only when an accepted-session snapshot or canonical
  child-run record proves that launch crossed the acceptance boundary. An
  exact spawn retry then returns those same reserved identities without
  invoking the child runner again;
- a reservation without canonical acceptance evidence is consumed as
  indeterminate during recovery. It is not projected as accepted and the lease
  is not reopened, preventing an ambiguous crash or failed rollback write from
  launching a second child;
- if the accepted session was persisted, an exact retry returns that session
  identity without invoking the child runner again.

Invalid fields, owner mismatches, expired or released leases, and conflicting
replay identities return `INVALID_REQUEST` and fail closed. Unexpected
operational failures return `UNAVAILABLE` so callers can retry the same
identity. Do not switch to a different lease or idempotency identity until the
prior request outcome and the recovery window have been evaluated.
