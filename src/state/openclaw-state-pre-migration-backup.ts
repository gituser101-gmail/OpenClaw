 *
 * OpenClaw migrates the state schema in place on startup. Once the on-disk

 * ("uses newer schema version N; this OpenClaw build supports M"), so an
 * interrupted, unwanted, or buggy upgrade has no recovery path unless a copy was
 * taken first. `VACUUM INTO` writes a single consistent snapshot (including
 * committed WAL frames) without holding a write transaction, so it is safe to
 * call on the live handle before the migration transaction begins.
 *
 * This is best effort: a backup failure is reported to the caller (which surfaces
 * it as a warning) rather than aborting startup, so a read-only or full backup
 * directory cannot brick a gateway that would otherwise migrate cleanly.
 *
 * Snapshots are written 0600 inside a 0700 directory, and the directory is capped
 * at `PRE_MIGRATION_BACKUP_RETENTION` copies, so this cannot accumulate shared
 * state on disk without bound.
